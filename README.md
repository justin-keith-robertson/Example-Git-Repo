# Video Game Project
This is going to be an example of using P5 to create video games in a browser.

`You can learn more about P5.js at the following `[link](https://p5js.org/reference/)

Also check out Dan from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM)

He does a really great series on creating games using P5 and other awesome ideas.

## How to start
---
- Run the following command in your terminal (inside of this directory) `python -m http.server`
    - This will start a server inside of your current directory to serve out the files.
- Next go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
- Update the [src/index.js](./src/index.js) file with your new code. 
    - You will notice that this file currently contains two functions:
        - setup() called when the website is first loaded
        - draw() gets called in a loop to draw elements on the canvas.
- Save your file
- Refresh your browser

###### There is a cooler way of developing website applications but lets start with the basics first and we will work our way up.
